# Worksheet 8. This assignment will be started in class on "DATE" Please have this file and the accompanied data "Brains.csv" saved to your device before class! 

#Name:

# Does learning a second language change brain structure? Machelli et al. (2004) tested 22 native Italian speakers who had learned English as a second language. Proficiencies in reading, writing, and speech were assessed by a proficiency score. Gray matter density was measured in the left inferior parietal region of the brain using a neuroimaging technique, as mm^3 of gray matter per voxel. Read in the Brains.csv table:



#1a. Build a general linear model of the data where proficiency score predicts brain matter. 


#1b. Prove to yourself that the sums of squares given by the anova() function for the model you just generated in step 1a are correct using the equations shown in class. Hint: the $fitted.values will be very useful in calculating sums of squares "by hand"! 


#2. How much variation in gray matter density does your model explain?




#3. Theory predicts that the slope should be 0.04. Test this statistical hypothesis.



#4. Make a scatterplot of the data and include a line that describes your model (i.e. the regression line) and lines showing the 95% confidence interval around your model.

#5. What is the difference between a predicted interval and confidence interval?

#6. Given your model, what statistical power do you have?
